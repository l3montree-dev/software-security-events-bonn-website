The main attraction is FOSDEM, Europe’s largest open source conference, which has inspired a range of side events, social activities, and workshops. For those interested in open technology, digital policy, and EU developments, OpenForum Europe’s EU Open Source Policy Summit brings together open source leaders and policymakers. Together, these events make up the EU Open Source Week.',
